# App Streamlit 

This project involves a Streamlit application designed to predict loan eligibility based on various customer characteristics. The app streamlines the decision-making process for banking loan officers and potential borrowers by providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.

Upon accessing the application, users are prompted to fill out an online form, where they input their personal and financial details such as the number of dependents, education level, employment status, property area, credit score, and monthly incomes for both the applicant and co-applicant. Additional inputs like the requested loan amount can also be provided.
